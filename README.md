This isn't my best code, but whatever. Introducingâ€¦

#Space Miner
####(A project for class)

The game is fairly self explanatory. Acquire green-orange rocks, avoid enemies and bullets. Space to shoot, arrow keys to move.

This game uses Qt 4.8.0; I don't use any advanced features, but no guarantees that it will run on earlier versions.

If you see a bug, it's a feature.
